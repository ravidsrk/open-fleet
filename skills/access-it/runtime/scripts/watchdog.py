"""Liveness watchdog: mechanized first response from runtime/worker-supervision.md.

The 2026-09-14 clean-sweep tracker run handled every stuck worker by hand: a
reviewer hung 60+ min with a transcript frozen 20+ min (nudged, unanswered,
stopped), a verdict worker wedged on a dead provider stream (nudged,
unanswered, stopped), four builders wedged on a provider-exhaustion dialog
(stopped + relaunched), and a reviewer stuck on a permission dialog with sends
blocked twice (stopped + re-dispatched). This script mechanizes the policy's
two highest-frequency responses — liveness watch and auto-nudge — and leaves
the expensive ones (stop, re-dispatch) as coordinator decisions.

Detection criteria (all thresholds from runtime/watchdog.json, tunable without
code edits; --help prints the effective values):

* OK:   last movement within slow_after_s. No action.
* SLOW: idle past slow_after_s but short of hung_after_s and its STOP.
  Slow-but-alive is not stuck: no action.
* HUNG: idle past hung_after_s, OR past its per-dispatch STOP with no report
  (the policy: past-STOP silence is STUCK, not slow). First response is one
  auto-nudge; still-HUNG after max_nudges_per_dispatch nudges escalates to a
  stop-redispatch RECOMMENDATION.
* WEDGED: positive wedge evidence — an explicit wedge marker (wedge_markers:
  e.g. send_blocked, provider_stream_dead, dialog_block, provider_exhausted),
  OR a transcript frozen past wedge_frozen_s beyond STOP plus an unanswered
  nudge (the policy's presence-not-absence test): last_nudge_at is set and
  nothing moved after it. Nudging a wedged worker is
  futile, so WEDGED recommends stop-redispatch immediately and never nudges.

Rate limits (anti-flap: a worker oscillating HUNG/OK must not cause a nudge
storm): at most max_nudges_per_dispatch nudges per dispatch, at least
nudge_window_s between nudges to one worker, and at most
max_nudges_per_hour_per_worker per worker per hour. Nudge history persists in
the state file so the limits hold across invocations.

CI-failure nudges (heartbeat ``ci_checks``, #590) carry their OWN per-dispatch
budget, max_ci_nudges_per_dispatch, recorded separately (state ``ci_nudges``),
so a CI nudge never spends the hang budget and a later real hang still gets
its nudge instead of jumping straight to a stop recommendation. Both kinds
obey the hourly cap and the nudge window, counted over EVERY nudge the worker
received (hang + CI); a hang nudge held back only by a CI nudge is deferred
(no nudge, no recommendation), never escalated. A CI nudge fires at most
once per distinct failure signature (state ``ci_signatures``).

``waiting_input`` (an unresolved HITL question gate) suppresses the NUDGE
action only: the worker is still classified, and a WEDGED or still-HUNG worker
still gets its stop-redispatch recommendation. When the heartbeat omits the
field and OPEN_FLEET_STATE_DB (or ORCA_FLEET_STATE_DB) names an existing
local-state database, the watchdog fills it by reading that database strictly
read-only (StateDBReader; senders matched by terminal handle, dispatch id, and
worker id). An unreadable database is a warning, never an abort.

Modes:

* --dry-run classifies and prints WOULD-nudge / WOULD-recommend with zero side
  effects: no subprocess, no state write, no log append. This is the mode CI
  and cautious coordinators use.
* live mode performs nudges by exec'ing nudge_command (argv placeholders
  {run_id} {worker_id} {dispatch_id} {text}; substituted per argv item, never
  through a shell) and appends every nudge/recommendation as JSONL carrying
  run id, worker id, dispatch id, timestamps, and the cited evidence. Live
  mode refuses to run without a nudge transport configured: a nudge the
  script cannot send must not be logged as sent.

Exit codes
    0  tick completed, nothing needs the coordinator
    1  tick completed, at least one stop-redispatch recommendation (or, under
       --dry-run, at least one WOULD-recommend)
    2  could not run — unreadable heartbeats/config/state (including a worker whose
       dispatched_at/last_movement_at is missing, null, empty, unparseable or in the
       future: its liveness cannot be judged), unknown config key, live mode without
       nudge_command, or a nudge transport failure
