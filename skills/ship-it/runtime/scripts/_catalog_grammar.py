"""The catalog's one grammar: frontmatter and composition, read the same way by every gate.

Private module, loaded by path (no sys.path edits) the way runtime/scripts loads its siblings.
It lives under runtime/scripts/ rather than scripts/ because quarantine_check.py and
proof_status.py ship inside every bundle (scripts/bundle.py vendors runtime/scripts whole) and
must load it beside themselves; scripts/validate.py, eval.py, gen-badges.py, release_check.py
and bundle.py load it from here too.

Two things are defined once here (2026-10-23 review, P1-9 / P1-10 / P2-11 / §5):

1. ``parse_frontmatter`` — five readers had drifted apart. validate.py's nested ``metadata:``
   reader had no block-scalar branch, so ``unit: >-`` plus indented text read as the literal
   ``>-``: the identity point tokenized to nothing and the collision gate scored it 0.0 against
   every mission. A plain multi-line scalar was cut at its first line, so the description and
   compatibility caps measured a fraction of the value. gen-badges split on every ``---`` and
   crashed on one inside a description. Now each reader calls this one.

2. The composition grammar — which names a mission makes mandatory (its Composes/rides clause:
   backticked names AND bare ``name.md`` tokens), which it defers (DEFERRED READS), and which it
   can reach at all (every protocol mention, followed transitively through the protocols it
   reaches). validate.py's quarantine gate read backticks only while the CLI and preflight read
   both, so the CI gate saw a strictly smaller set than the start gate; neither followed a
   playbook into the playbooks it calls.

Stdlib-only.
