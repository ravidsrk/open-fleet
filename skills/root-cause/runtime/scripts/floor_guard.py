"""Diff-scoped floor guard: the cheap road to green, caught mechanically.

Six moves lower the bar without touching a stated requirement: a silenced
checker, a test made easier, unfinished work left as a stub, an assertion
deleted from a test that stayed, a threshold walked down in the constraints
file (or a new exception row admitted beside it), and a touch to the frozen
guard surface (the tool-config the bar stands on). Each is invisible to a green
build and obvious in a diff. This guard reads the diff.

Scope is the merge base against ``--base`` plus the working tree plus untracked
files -- a guard that reads only ``git diff`` misses the new file. Tightening is
silent; loosening is loud: only moves that lower the bar are reported.

Rules (rule ids are stable; a waiver names one):

===================  ============================================================

                     (``test_x`` removed, ``_test_x``/``disabled_test_x`` added)
unfinished-work      ``TODO``/``FIXME``/``XXX``, ``NotImplementedError``,

assertion-removed    a REMOVED line carrying ``assert``, ``expect(``, ``should``,
                     ``self.assert``, ``t.Error`` in a path that looks like a test
                     and still exists at HEAD. A deleted test file is not this rule
                     -- unless half its lines reappear elsewhere in the diff (a
                     rename or move under ``--no-renames``): then each assertion not

threshold-lowered    a numbered row of the constraints file whose number went DOWN,
                     matched in order by the row/bullet key left of the first ``|``
                     or ``:`` -- a numbered row deleted, re-keyed (``D1`` -> ``D1b``)
                     or with its number worded away is the same move
new-exception        an added constraints row shaped ``| W123 |`` / ``| E45 |``, or
                     an added line under an ``## Exceptions`` heading
guard-surface        an added/removed line touching CONSTRAINTS.md's frozen guard
                     surface (whole files: any line; keyed files: the key's
                     assignment only — a use-site or comment stays silent)
===================  ============================================================

Exemptions come from the DECISIONS log, never from an ignore file. A waiver is a
record whose ID is ``floor-waiver:<rule>:<path-or-glob>`` and whose ANSWER
grants -- a bare directory is not a waiver, and neither is ``**``. Scope in the
id gives the waiver an identity the ledger can retire, so a later ``superseded``
row ends it exactly as it ends any other decision, and ``decisions.active``
decides which waivers still stand. No prose is parsed: a sentence that mentions
a rule and a path is not a waiver (#313, PR #308 review).

A waiver is read from the BASE ref's ledger (``git cat-file`` of ``<base>:docs/DECISIONS.md``),
never from the tree under review: a change cannot write its own exemption, so a waiver lands on
the base branch first (2026-10-23 review, P1-7). And it grants only as a one-way human grant --
class ``one-way``, a ``[source=human:<name>]`` suffix, and, when the base ref pins
``.orca/human-grant-pubkey``, a signature that verifies (decisions.py ``grant_problems``, the
same check ``decisions.py check`` runs). CONSTRAINTS.md says the bar moves only by a one-way
human decision; a ``taste`` or ``mechanical`` ``allow``, including every waiver recorded before
this rule, no longer grants -- by design. The guard names such a line when it is the only thing
standing between a finding and a waiver.

Every diff is taken with ``--text`` and ``--no-color`` and pins the prefix and colour keys on
its own command line (``DIFF_RENDERING``): a ``.gitattributes`` ``-diff`` (or a NUL byte)
rendered every touched file as ``Binary files differ`` and blanked every rule (P1-6), and a
repo-local prefix or colour setting hid every path from the parser (P2-4). C-quoted header
paths (non-ASCII, quotes, control bytes) are decoded, so a quoted test path is not mistaken
for a deleted one (P2-6).
CONSTRAINTS.md stays out of the whole-file guard surface on purpose: the threshold rules
above already catch every way a numbered row can lose its number, and a whole-file surface
would demand a pre-landed one-way waiver for a dated evidence note or a typo fix.

Reporting is redaction-first: rule id, ``file:line`` and a short pattern name --
never the matched text, which may be the credential someone tried to suppress.

Exit codes
    0  clean
    1  at least one un-waived finding (block the change)
    2  the guard could not run -- not a git repo, no merge base, unreadable
       waiver file or malformed base-ref grant key. Never let a 2 read as a 0.

How to wire
    Run it OFF the worker, never inside the builder loop: a guard the builder can
    see is a guard the builder edits. Two consumers. (1) A GUARD unit in the
    floor-it mission runs it against the unit's base and treats exit 1 as the
    unit's failing oracle -- the script IS the reviewed CI unit. (2) An
    independent verifier runs it over a mutation unit's diff before any
    judgement-based review: a diff that trips ``test-made-easier`` or
    ``assertion-removed`` fails the negative-control leg deterministically, so a
    disabled test cannot hide behind a hand-written negative-control note. Exit 2
    parks the unit (a shallow CI checkout must not present as a clean floor).
    It is regex-shallow by design: a floor under review, never a replacement for it.

    fixed the mention and not the meaning: a structured record with that ID and answer `deny` still
    granted, because the line was still read as a bag of tokens. Checking each record's own answer
